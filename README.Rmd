### Outliers

Outliers play an important part in this data set.  Statistically, outliers are observations that fall beyond the upper and lower quartiles by at least 1.5 times the interquartile range. While outliers can represent collection errors, they can also represent real environmental anomalies that lead to new discoveries or help to explain a greater trend in the data.  For these reasons, I have used a conservative approach in handling outliers.

For this data set, I chose to include all observations below the first quartile.  My reasoning is as follows: First, it is reasonable to assume that abnormally low temperature readings are legitimate.  Given Bonaire's hot climate, unnatural readings are difficult to produce unless the sensor malfunctions or the sensor is placed in an artificially cooled environment.  Second, upwellings of colder water have been recorded in the past, and these upwellings can have a significant effect on the environment.  Thus, their presence is an important feature for study.

Outliers above the third quartile were carefully considered.  In reviewing the data, it is clear that some temperature readings are impossible ocean temperatures.  There is also a plausible scenario in which the data sensors continued to record temperatures when they were brought above water, likely laying on a boat in direct sun during cleaning and data retrieval.  I concluded that the impossible values should be removed from the dataset so as to yield a more accurate analysis, but choosing a threshold for unnatural observations was challenging.  Initially, I calculated the the threshold using that standard statistical outlier method (Q3 + 1.5 x IQR) for each year; however, a significant number of observations fall along that temperature.  After consulting Erik Meesters, Tropical Marine Ecologist and Bio Statistician at Wageningen Marine Research, I agreed with his suggestion that any observations above 33 degrees celsius were not recorded in the water[^1].  The visualizations below help to confirm that while a 33 degree threshold is somewhat arbitrary, this higher threshold includes potentially natural outliers while excluding the majority of observations that are truly impossible.  This method could be deemed overly conservative or simplistic, but as Erik aptly suggested, it would be prudent not to omit any observations unless you are 100% sure  the reading is wrong.

## Data Analysis

I aggregated the data by date, site, and depth, then filtered for the daily minimum, maximum, and average temperatures.

```{r daily min/max and avg water temp by day, echo=FALSE}
#2020
temp20mm <- tl2020_33 %>% 
  select(date, site, depth_m, temp_c) %>%
  group_by(site, depth_m, date) %>% 
  summarise(max_temp = max(temp_c),
            min_temp = min(temp_c),
            avg_temp = mean(temp_c)) %>%
  arrange(date, site, depth_m)

#2021
temp21mm <- tl2021_33 %>% 
  select(date, site, depth_m, temp_c) %>%
  group_by(site, depth_m, date) %>% 
  summarise(max_temp = max(temp_c),
            min_temp = min(temp_c),
            avg_temp = mean(temp_c)) %>%
  arrange(date, site, depth_m)

#2022
temp22mm <- tl2022_33 %>% 
  select(date, site, depth_m, temp_c) %>%
  group_by(site, depth_m, date) %>% 
  summarise(max_temp = max(temp_c),
            min_temp = min(temp_c),
            avg_temp = mean(temp_c)) %>%
  arrange(date, site, depth_m)

#Combine all years
temp_mma <- temp20mm %>%
  bind_rows(temp21mm) %>%
  bind_rows(temp22mm) %>%
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date))

```


```{r visualizing general temperature trends, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(temp_mma, aes(month,  avg_temp, color = factor(year))) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, span = 0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Year", 
                       labels = c("2020", "2021", "2022"),
                       values = c("deepskyblue1","darkviolet","darkblue"),
                       guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, "Month") + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(26, 30), breaks = seq(26, 30, 1), "Water Temperature (c)") + 
    ggtitle("Average of Water Temperature") 


ggplot(temp_mma, aes(date, avg_temp, color = factor(depth_m))) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Temperature (c)",
       color = "Depth (m)",
       title = "Average Water Temperature")


ggplot(temp_mma, aes(factor(depth_m), avg_temp, color = site)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Depth (m)",
       y = "Temperature (c)",
       color = "Site",
       title = "Average Water Temperature")
```


Below is a summary of the data collected by location.  Of all the sites, STINAPA collected the most data from Klein Bonaire 1.  Of all the depths, the most data was collected at 12 meters.  Finally, the most data collected for a specific location (site and depth) was from Harbor Village and 20 meters.

The histogram indicates that the data is multi-modal.  Also, no one site appears to be significantly skewed in temperature.  
Given this information, I made the decision to use the data collected at 12 meters for my time series model.  By isolating my model to one depth, I hope to create a more accurate model than if I were to assume all the data collected followed the same trend, regardless of depth.

```{r reviewing data by site and depth, echo=FALSE}

table(temp_mma$site, temp_mma$depth_m) 
table(temp_mma$site, temp_mma$depth_m) %>% rowSums() 
table(temp_mma$site, temp_mma$depth_m) %>% colSums()
### can these be formatted to plotted with nice_table?

temp_mma %>% filter(depth_m == 12) %>%
  ggplot(aes(avg_temp, fill = site)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(site)) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (c)", 
       y = "Observations",
       fill = "Site")
```



Below are tables of the lowest temperatures for each year.  From the *Temperature Variations* plots above, it is apparent that 2020 and 2022 had isolated low temperature events while the recorded temperatures in October 2021 were more graduated.
It is interesting that the isolated low temperature events in 2022 were all recorded at six meters.  No significant low temperatures were recorded at lower depths.  

```{r review of low outliers, echo=FALSE}

# 2020 low temp outliers
temp20mm %>% filter(temp_c < 23) %>% arrange(date)  %>%
  rename("Date" = date, "Site" = site, "Depth (m)" = depth_m, "Temp (c)" = temp_c) %>%
  nice_table(title = "2020 Temperatures Below 23 Degrees")

#2021 low temp outliers
temp21mm %>% filter(temp_c < 23) %>% arrange(date)  %>%
  rename("Date" = date, "Site" = site, "Depth (m)" = depth_m, "Temp (c)" = temp_c) %>%
  nice_table(title = "2021 Temperatures Below 23 Degrees",
             note = "Multiple values during a single day represent the daily high and low temperatures recordings.")

#2022 low temp outliers
temp22mm %>% filter(temp_c < 23) %>% arrange(date)  %>%
  rename("Date" = date, "Site" = site, "Depth (m)" = depth_m, "Temp (c)" = temp_c) %>%
  nice_table(title = "2022 Temperatures Below 23 Degrees")
```
